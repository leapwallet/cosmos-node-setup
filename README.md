# Juno AWS Setup

This repo explains how to set up a [Juno](https://www.junonetwork.io/) mainnet archive node on AWS. I created it because
there are zero articles, videos, etc. on doing this, and even the official docs on how to just set up the Juno node are
incorrect.

Every section in this document can be used independently of the others. For example, you can swap out the AWS setup in
favor of your own hardware configuration, and the rest of the document will still apply verbatim.

## To-dos

This repo is a WIP, and must be updated by the author to include [these](docs/to-dos.md) instructions.

## Concepts

You will need to understand these [concepts](docs/concepts.md) in order to effectively run the node.

## AWS Configuration

[This](docs/aws-config.md) section explains how to set up the hardware (AWS EC2 and AWS EBS) upon which the node will
run by using the AWS Management Console.
