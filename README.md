# Cosmos Node Setup

This repo explains how to set up [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) nodes. We created it because there are zero comprehensive articles, videos, etc. on doing this, and the official docs on how to just set up a node is confusing.

This repo is written for people who know nothing about running a Cosmos node. While concepts specific to operating Cosmos nodes (e.g., how much storage is required, how to connect the blockchain node to Prometheus) are explained, concepts specific to Cosmos (e.g., what a blockchain is), and tools used (e.g., what Prometheus is) etc. aren't explained. This is because the official docs are good, and you can look up only what you need to based on your experience level.

Here's the [overview](docs/overview.md).
