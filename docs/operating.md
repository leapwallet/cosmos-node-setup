# Operating the Node

## Sync Status

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

Prints `true` if the node is still downloading the older blocks, and `false` otherwise.

## Genesis Error

The node might repeatedly crash with the following error message:

```
Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

In this case, you must run `$DAEMON_NAME unsafe-reset-all` (such as for `junod`) or `$DAEMON_NAME tendermint --home $DAEMON_HOME unsafe-reset-all` (such as for `seid`) which will wipe the DB. This error only has the potential to surface when initially setting up the node, and not after the node has been downloading blocks, upgrading, etc.

## Upgrades

Remember to subscribe to new upgrade notifications. For example, you should join Juno's [#âš¡ | validator-lounge](https://discord.com/channels/816256689078403103/816263136491339867) Discord channel where they try to announce new upgrades a few days in advance if you're running a Juno node.

### Available Upgrades for Juno Mainnet Archive Nodes

After installing the first version (i.e., 3.0.0), the following versions must be installed at their respective block heights (certain versions such as 7.0.0 must be skipped due to bugs, and are therefore left out):

|Version|Block height|
|:---:|:---:|
|3.1.1|2,616,300|
|4.0.0|2,951,100|
|5.0.1|3,035,000|
|6.0.0|3,159,650|
|8.0.0|3,851,750|

Since this document may be outdated, please additionally check [this](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/mainnet-upgrades) page for versions and block heights. Only check the version tags (e.g., `v8.0.0`), and their respective block heights on the page because the upgradation instructions are confusing. Instead, use the [upgradation](#upgrading) section of this document.

### Upgrading

This section explains how to upgrade a node.

Set the height at which the node must be upgraded at (e.g., the block height to install Juno v3.1.1 at is 2,616,300):

 ```shell
 read -P 'Enter the block height to halt at: ' HEIGHT
 sed "s|halt-height = 0|halt-height = $HEIGHT|" -i $DAEMON_HOME/config/app.toml
 ```

Upgrade the node once it has halted:

```shell
###########################
## BEGIN: Reinstall node ##
###########################

read -P 'Enter the directory the node\'s GitHub repo was downloaded to (e.g., juno): ' DIR
cd $DIR
git fetch --tags
set PROMPT 'Enter the upgrade\'s git tag (e.g., v3.1.1) commit hash (e.g., 4ec1b0ca818561cef04f8e6df84069b14399590e): '
read -P $PROMPT VERSION
git checkout VERSION
make install

#########################
## END: Reinstall node ##
#########################

############################
## BEGIN: Set halt height ##
############################

read -P 'Enter the next block halt height to halt at, or 0 if there isn\'t one: ' HEIGHT
sed "s|halt-height = 0|halt-height = $HEIGHT|" -i $DAEMON_HOME/config/app.toml
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart $DAEMON_NAME

##########################
## END: Set halt height ##
##########################
```
