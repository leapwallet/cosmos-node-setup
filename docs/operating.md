# Operating the Node

## Sync Status

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

Prints `true` if the node is still downloading the older blocks, and `false` otherwise.

## Logs

```shell
journalctl -fu <BINARY>
```

Follows the journal for the `<BINARY>` systemd unit. This is useful to check whether the chain has halted, which block it's currently downloading, any error message that got printed if the node crashed, etc.

## Genesis Error

The node might repeatedly crash with the following error message:

```
Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

In this case, you must run `<BINARY> unsafe-reset-all` which will wipe the DB. This error only has the potential to surface when initially setting up the node, and not after the node has been downloading blocks, upgrading, etc.

## Available Upgrades for Juno

This section is only relevant if you're upgrading a Juno mainnet archive node.

After installing the first version (i.e., 3.0.0), the following versions must be installed at their respective block heights (certain versions such as 7.0.0 must be skipped due to bugs, and are therefore left out):

|Version|Block height|
|:---:|:---:|
|3.1.1|2,616,300|
|4.0.0|2,951,100|
|5.0.1|3,035,000|
|6.0.0|3,159,650|
|8.0.0|3,851,750|

Since this document may be outdated, please additionally check [this](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/mainnet-upgrades) page for versions and block heights. Only check the version tags (e.g., `v8.0.0`), and their respective block heights on the page because the upgradation instructions are confusing. Instead, use the [upgradation](#upgrading) section of this document.

In order to get notified of new upgrades, you should join Juno's [#âš¡ | validator-lounge](https://discord.com/channels/816256689078403103/816263136491339867) Discord channel where they try to announce new upgrades a few days in advance.

## Upgrading

Here's how to upgrade the node:
1. Wait for the chain to halt. For example, the block height to install Juno v3.1.1 at is 2,616,300.
2. Change the directory:

    ```shell
    cd <DIR>
    ```

    Replace `<DIR>` with the directory that the Cosmos node's GitHub repo was downloaded to (e.g., `~/juno`).
3. Fetch the tags:

    ```shell
    git fetch --tags
    ```
4. Check out the upgrade's tag:

    ```shell
    git checkout <VERSION>
    ```

   Replace `<VERSION>` with the upgrade's tag (e.g., `v3.1.1`).
5. Install:

    ```shell
    make install
    ```
6. If the installation succeeded, then the following command will print the `<VERSION>` from step 4:

    ```shell
    <BINARY> version
    ```
7. Update the halt height:

    ```shell
    sed -i 's/halt-height = .*/halt-height = <HEIGHT>/' <CHAIN_DIR>/config/app.toml
    ```

   Replace `<HEIGHT>` with the next upgrade's block height if there is one, and `0` otherwise.
8. Reload systemd:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
9. Restart Juno:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart <BINARY>
    ```
