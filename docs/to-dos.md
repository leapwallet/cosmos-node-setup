# To-dos

- Use Fish instead of the default shell.
- Use Terraform.
- Set up rate limiting.
- Maybe use the default Caddy systemd unit file instead of our modified one.
- Set up Prometheus. Doc exposing the Prometheus port only to the Grafana server.
- Set up Grafana dashboards and alerts. Preferably, make your own dashboard people can use by following [this](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/best-practices/common-observability-strategies/) strategy, and [this](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/best-practices/dashboard-management-maturity-levels/) model.
- Set up PANIC.
- Set up logs.
- Use Docker.
- Automate installation similar to how Osmosis did.
