# To-dos

- Use EC2 Spot instances, savings plans, and budget alerts. Use two EC2 instances in different AZs for redundancy with a load balancer. Obviously, only back up one of the AWS EBS volumes.
- Use Fish instead of the default shell.
- Use Terraform.
- Set up rate limiting.
- Set up the DNS.
- Set up Prometheus.
- Set up Grafana.
- Set up PANIC.
- Set up logs.
- Skipping the upgradation process by simply downloading the archive. Maybe Docker can be used to more easily set up the server then.
- Only expose the Prometheus server to the Grafana one in the firewall.
